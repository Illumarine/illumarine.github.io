            <h3>illumos-Based</h3>
            <p>
              Illumarine is a desktop-focused operating system based on the
              illumos (OpenSolaris) family of operating systems
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>User Oriented</h3>
            <p>
              We aim to make Illumarine as easy to use as humanly possible. We
              do this through ports of existing software, and making our own.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3>Community Driven</h3>
            <p>
              No corporate entity decides what happens to Illumarine. We are
              fully independent, and 100% built by the community.

        <h2>About Illumarine</h2>
        <p>
          Illumarine is a different take on illumos at its core. Barry (the
          creator of Illumarine) wanted to take their two main daily driver
          operating systems (OpenIndiana and Ultramarine Linux) and merge the
          best of the two very different worlds together. Noticing how Linux in
          general is becomming more and more popular, plus the many current
          faults of the ecosystem, Barry started working on Illumarine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally as a joke within Ultramarine Linux's community, Barry
          decided to take the project seriously, and ultimately aims to build
          something that is easy to work with as Linux, while keeping a more
          sane, lighter operating system altogether.
